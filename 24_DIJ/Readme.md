## Instructions:
1. Use git to clone this the LM folder from Whitgit to a local machine 
2. Submit your code (python, c++, etc.) in this folder
3. Upload a screen shot snip of acceptance for each SPOJ solution
4. Use git to push your changes to the LM folder to Whitgit
5. You must not share code electronically, you may however discuss with classmates the solution approach for solving the problems. 
6. YOu must write your own code. If someone helps you solve a problem, or you find an answer online, you MUST cite the resource used. 
7. You MUST NOT use any resource online directly related to these problems!

__REMEMBER__: It is a serious academic integrity violation to copy code electronically or share your code electronically with another student!
